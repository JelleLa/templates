# RELEASE NOTES [v.1.2]
* \latex repository now depricated and unsupported. 
* Files are now .tex files only, not packaged in .zip's. Importing in Overleaf has to be done manually.
* Small edits to ensure files compile without any usepackages not available in TeXLive, the default LaTeX distribution in Linux.

# KNOWN ISSUES
* Currently, most documemts are fully centered.
